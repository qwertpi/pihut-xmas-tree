# pihut-xmas-tree
This is the code that I run on my [pihut xmas tree](https://thepihut.com/products/3d-xmas-tree-for-raspberry-pi)

tree.py and star.py should both be running. Kudos to anyone who can use [threading](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html) or anything to turn it into one program and then make a pull request
