# pihut-xmas-tree
This is the code that I run on my [pihut xmas tree](https://thepihut.com/products/3d-xmas-tree-for-raspberry-pi)
tree.py changes each red LEDs brightness values randomly and star.py flashes the top "star" LED with it flashing faster as Christmas Day aproaches

tree.py and star.py should both be running for maximum effect.
Feedback and pull requests are very welcome
